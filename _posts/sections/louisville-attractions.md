Despite Louisville’s size, a great many points of interest are located within ten minutes (2-5 miles) of the hotel.

Further, unlike some other metropolitan regions with populations exceeding a million, Louisville can typically be navigated quickly from end to end.

Whether you’ll be visiting an art museum, wandering any of our myriad award-winning parks, doing some antiquing, touring a distillery (bourbon or brandy–pick your poison), snuggling inside a cat café, eating until you’ve reached maximum capacity, seeking out historical facts behind our local ghosts, spending quality time with the skeletons of a couple of Catholic saints, or even, say, zip-lining inside a giant cavern, it’s all within easy reach.

There’ll be plenty of structured activities organized by the Convergence committee and others during the three official days, but there’s really quite a lot to do here, so you might want to consider extending your stay.
