Nestled in the dead center of the states that comprise the US’s Midwest, East, and South sits Kentucky, and the best features of each of these regions are well-represented in Louisville. Its burgeoning art, music, theater, and culinary cultures, combined with its rich history and natural splendor, themselves, have much to offer, and, oh… we have a Goth scene, too.

These Victorian-era garden cemeteries aren’t just going to appreciate themselves, after all.

[Radio Arcane](https://www.radio-arcane.com), [Art Sanctuary](http://www.art-sanctuary.org), and really, all of Louisville are delighted that our fair city has been chosen for Convergence 26. We have much to share with you.
