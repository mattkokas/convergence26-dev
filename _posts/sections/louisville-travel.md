Travel to Louisville, the birthplace of Hunter S. Thompson, Muhammad Ali, the song, “Happy Birthday To You,” and Funeral Party Records, is a generally painless endeavor, as we’re home to an international* airport that serves all major carriers. It’s also at the intersections of interstate highways 64, 65, and 71, for those who prefer the scenic route. (And indeed, the scenery is great.)

*[Admittedly, the “international” designation is limited to its role as a UPS hub, but it’s still technically correct, which is the very best kind of correct. Regardless, domestic flights into Louisville are typically a trouble-free endeavor, and the airport provides the usual assortment of ground transportation options.]*
