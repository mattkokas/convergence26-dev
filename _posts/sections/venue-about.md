Louisville’s Goth scene is fortunate enough to have a physical home of its own—[Art Sanctuary](http://www.art-sanctuary.org), which is named for its community-oriented arts collective that was founded to support local visual, literary, and performing arts. It’s a massive, 26,000 sq. ft. structure, roughly half of which is dedicated to a capacious, high-ceilinged event facility with an expansive stage and full bar, and in a separate, somewhat quieter room, an art gallery with ample seating for those who’d prefer to relax and enjoy conversation.

Incidentally, in its capacity as a bar, Art Sanctuary is licensed as an 18+, 4am venue. Post-concert dancing will continue until you’re on the verge of collapse, in accordance with our local custom.
