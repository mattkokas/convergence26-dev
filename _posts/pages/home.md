      Nestled in the dead center of the states that comprise the US’s Midwest,
      East, and South sits Kentucky, and the best features of each of these
      regions are well-represented in Louisville. Its burgeoning art, music,
      theater, and culinary cultures, combined with its rich history and natural
      splendor, themselves, have much to offer, and, oh… we have a Goth scene,
      too.These Victorian-era garden cemeteries aren’t just going to appreciate
      themselves, after all.[Radio Arcane](https://www.radio-arcane.com), [Art
      Sanctuary](http://www.art-sanctuary.org), and really, all of Louisville
      are delighted that our fair city has been chosen for Convergence 26. We
      have much to share with you. TEST

      The official hotel for Convergence 26 is the gorgeous, spacious,
      well-appointed, river-adjacent [Galt
      House](https://book.passkey.com/go/Convergence26).


      Convergence 26 room booking for the Galt House Hotel is now immediately
      [available](https://book.passkey.com/go/Convergence26). West Tower deluxe
      rooms (two queen beds or one king bed) are $159, and East Tower executive
      suites (two queen beds and a separate living room with sofa bed, dining
      table, mini-fridge, and wet bar) are $189.


      A waterfront suite version of the West Tower room is also available for
      $209.


      The block ranges from Friday to Monday, but for those who’d prefer to
      spend more time with us, we’ve also arranged for these discounted rates to
      be honored for guests within our block for the three days pre and post.
      Feel free to check in as early as Tuesday, if that’s your pleasure. If the
      room type on the date range you’re seeking does not appear on Passkey (if
      for example, you’d like to check in early and leave late), please [contact
      us](/contact) so that we can have that immediately added. Not all
      available rooms are readily blocked for dates outside of the
      officially-official Convergence event dates, and while we’ll be keeping an
      eye on the room block status in the effort to preempt things temporarily
      getting filled, please feel free to [reach out to us](/contact) right away
      if you encounter any difficulties.
