            <p>Nestled in the dead center of the states that comprise the US’s Midwest, East, and South sits Kentucky, and the best features of each of these regions are well-represented in Louisville. Its burgeoning art, music, theater, and culinary cultures, combined with its rich history and natural splendor, themselves, have much to offer, and, oh… we have a Goth scene, too.</p>

            <p>These Victorian-era garden cemeteries aren’t just going to appreciate themselves, after all.</p>

            <p>Louisville’s Goth scene is fortunate enough to have a physical home of its own that isn’t subject to the typical whims of a commercial entity. <a href="http://www.art-sanctuary.org" target="_blank">Art Sanctuary</a>–a 501(c)(3) non-profit–is a community-oriented arts collective supporting local visual, literary and performing arts. A subset of this, <a href="https://www.radio-arcane.com" target="_blank">Radio Arcane</a>, is the project of Art Sanctuary that gathers a collective of DJs and performers that regularly hosts events, live music, and dark arts entertainment—curators for all things dark and beautiful within our fair city.</p>

            <p>Radio Arcane wants to bring Convergence to Louisville, not only to delight and entertain you, but also to share with you a bit of ourselves. Our primary mission is to help this Goth community to thrive, not merely survive, and we do this, wholeheartedly, as a labor of love. This culture of ours reflects who we are, individually and collectively, and we want to celebrate that with all who would gather with us. Those who flock to Convergence are our people, and as such, we offer you our hospitality. We offer you our home.</p>

         <p>Travel to Louisville, the birthplace of Hunter S. Thompson, Muhammad Ali, the song, “Happy Birthday To You,” and <a href="https://www.thefuneralparty.com" target="_blank">Funeral Party Records</a>, is a generally painless endeavor, as we’re home to an international* airport that serves all major carriers. It’s also at the intersections of interstate highways 64, 65, and 71, for those who prefer the scenic route. (And indeed, the scenery is great.)</p>

         <ul>

         </ul>

         <p><small><em>* [Admittedly, the “international” designation is limited to its role as a UPS hub, but it’s still technically correct, which is the very best kind of correct. Regardless, domestic flights into Louisville are typically a trouble-free endeavor, and the airport provides the usual assortment of ground transportation options.]</em></small></p>

         <p>Despite Louisville’s size, a great many points of interest are located within ten minutes (2-5 miles) of the hotel.</p>

         <p>Further, unlike some other metropolitan regions with populations exceeding a million, Louisville can typically be navigated quickly from end to end.</p>

         <p>Whether you’ll be visiting an art museum, wandering any of our myriad award-winning parks, doing some antiquing, touring a distillery (bourbon or brandy–pick your poison), snuggling inside a cat café, eating until you’ve reached maximum capacity, seeking out historical facts behind our local ghosts, spending quality time with the skeletons of a couple of Catholic saints, or even, say, zip-lining inside a giant cavern, it’s all within easy reach.</p>

         <p>There’ll be plenty of structured activities organized by the Convergence committee and others during the three official days, but there’s really quite a lot to do here, so you might want to consider extending your stay.</p>
